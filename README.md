# Plotting

This is the plotting repo. I strongly recommend having a relatively new version of matplotlib because in newer matplotlib the legend placement is much smarter.

Kinematics plotting is handled in plotters/kin.py. This runs straight off the .parquet datasets 

EEC res4 plotting is handled in plotters/res4.py. This requires binned histograms.

I don't have a projected EEC plotter at the moment, but it should be easy to put together.
